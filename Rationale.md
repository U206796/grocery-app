# grocery app

Rationale for assignment one. 

I would like to begin saying that I really enjoyed this project.  I believe I have begun to understand client and server-side languages in more depth.  However, as you see from my website application, I have had multiple issues and have gone back to basics. 

The application idea I chose was a grocery shopping list.  The idea behind this was it would be an online platform that families or shared households could utilise with the same access to their shopping lists through the login details.  This would allow users to gradually add items when they come to mind, like a Google Doc but for grocery items. 

Initially, the application was off to a great start.  I found the content through Canvas very helpful, however, I utilised online resources such as W3 Schools https://www.w3schools.com/ and Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/ often.  I found the forums on both websites very insightful for identifying and rectifying specific issues. 

I have found the process difficult, specifically using PhpMyAdmin.  I had a previous application that I was happy with, I had applied sufficient CSS to stylise et cetera.  However, a couple of days before the assignment was due, I logged on to my computer refresh my website and found that my links were not working.  This was when remotely hosting my application.  It was then that I realised that the MYSQL database was not loading and PhpMyAdmin had locked me out.  Again, I took to the forums, tried to resolve, however no success. 

I wanted to submit at least a working application.  So, I went back to MAMP, checked the preferences.  I still could not find the issue.  It was then that I figured that if it wasn’t working remotely through PhpMyAdmin there was the potential if I connected to Site Ground and the specific database details through the Site Tools, I might be able to get it working.  

As you have noticed, it is working but to the bare minimum.  This again had its issues, will uploading my files through FileZilla I had the error message “Could not Connect to Server”.  To overcome this issue, I directly uploaded the files to the File Manager on Site ground.  The application began working, so I decided to not mess around with the files and submit a very basic application.  

The original issue with PhpMyAdmin was not resolved, just overcome.  If you can see an error in one of my files, please let me know.  I would appreciate it.
